# tetris-online

A multiplayer Tetris game playable online via WebSocket with some additions to make the game a bit more funny. Toy project made to learn about websocket and because I always loved Tetris.

# Demo

Just open https://tetris-multiplayer.onrender.com/index.html, wait for the URL to change (a
dinamically generated URL will be created), send the new URL to a friend to add a player to
the match.

## Contribute

To install
`npm install`

To start the dev server
`npm run start`

NOTE: There is no production build (this project is just for fun)
